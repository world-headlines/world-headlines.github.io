The wader has held mythical status in Western Palearctic – and indeed global – birding terms. It has always been poorly understood and has always been considered rare, with its breeding grounds little known. A paper published in IBIS documents and quantifies the extinction of Slender-billed Curlew.	http://www.birdguides-cdn.com/cdn/news/Slender-billedCurlew-MerdjaZergaFeb1989copy.jpg?&width=1200&height=630&mode=crop&format=webp&webp.quality=85&scale=down	2024-11-18 09:01:33	Birdguides
