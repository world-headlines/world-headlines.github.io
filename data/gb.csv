gb	https://www.birdguides.com/news/slender-billed-curlew-declared-extinct/	Slender-billed Curlew declared extinct - Birdguides	Slender-billed Curlew has been declared extinct following a new study that puts to bed any hopes that the shorebird may still exist and marks the first known global bird extinction from mainland Europe. The wader has held mythical status in Western Palearctic – and indeed global – birding terms. It has always been poorly understood and has always been considered rare, with its breeding grounds little known. A paper published in IBIS documents and quantifies the extinction of Slender-billed Curlew.	http://www.birdguides-cdn.com/cdn/news/Slender-billedCurlew-MerdjaZergaFeb1989copy.jpg?&width=1200&height=630&mode=crop&format=webp&webp.quality=85&scale=down	2024-11-18 09:01:33	Birdguides
