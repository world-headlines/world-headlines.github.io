In 2025 Middlesex men will play the same volume of cricket at Lord’s Cricket Ground as in 2024, with six of our seven home County Championship matches being played at the Home of Cricket, with Lord’s once again hosting one of the Club’s One-Day Cup clashes.  Having recently sent out a survey to members asking for feedback on their preferred venues for the Club to play at when Lord’s is unavailable, the strong consensus pointed towards Radlett and Merchant Taylors’ School, so we are pleased to confirm that our one remaining home men’s County Championship encounter will be played at Merchant Taylors’ School, with the remaining three home One-Day Cup matches all being hosted by Radlett Cricket Club.   As announced last week, the women will feature at Lord’s in the Vitality Blast, in a double-header alongside the men against Sussex on Thursday 29th May, however their One-Day Cup matches will be split across both Radlett and Merchant Taylors’ School, with two home matches being played at each venue.  WOMEN'S 2025 HOME FIXTURES  The women’s Metro Bank One-Day Cup League Two campaign gets underway on Sunday 20th April against Kent at Radlett, before we face Gloucestershire, also at Radlett, on Wednesday 15th May.   A switch in formats then sees a break from 50-over action whilst the Vitality Blast takes place, before the One-Day Cup returns in August, with our last two home group matches of the competition taking place at Merchant Taylors’ School, against Derbyshire on Saturday 9th August and against Worcestershire on Saturday 30th August.  MEN'S 2025 HOME FIXTURES  The men’s competitive season kicks off with two home County Championship matches at Lord’s in April, against Lancashire starting on Friday 4th April and then against Glamorgan from Friday 18th April.  Lord’s will then host two further Championship games in May, with Kent visiting the Home of Cricket from Friday 2nd May and Leicestershire from Friday 16th May.   Attention then turns to the Vitality Blast, with two away four-day matches sandwiched in between Blast fixtures in June and July, before we return to County Championship action from Tuesday 22nd July, when Merchant Taylors’ School will host our one out-ground four-day fixture against Northamptonshire.  We finish the County Championship home campaign with two further clashes at Lord’s, against Derbyshire from Monday 8th September and our final game of the season against Gloucestershire starting on Wednesday 24th September.   The One-Day Cup competition will again be played alongside the Hundred in August, with Radlett hosting us first on 6th August against Somerset, before Sussex visit Lord’s on Sunday 10th August. The 50-over group stage home matches are then completed with two further games at Radlett, against Yorkshire on Sunday 17th August and against Kent on Tuesday 19th August.  Lord's will host the World Test Championship final in June, an England v India men's Test and women’s One-Day International in July, and Middlesex’s Vitality Blast matches across both months. Due to ECB's specific calendar slots for each competition and the volume of cricket and the time needed for pitch preparation, it is not possible for Lord's to host County Championship matches during the allocated June and July periods.Both the men's and women's fixtures can be downloaded as PDF's via HERE for the men's fixtures and via HERE for the women's fixtures.Why not download the 2025 fixtures to your smartphone device.
