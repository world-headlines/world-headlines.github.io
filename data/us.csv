Sources in Portugal, speaking anonymously as they&#8217;re not authorised to discuss the matter, have told The Athletic the 39-year-old is open to taking up the opportunity after Erik ten Hag was sacked earlier on Monday.
United are ready to pay the €10million (£8.3m) release clause in his contract with the two clubs in talks to finalise a deal that could see Ruud van Nistelrooy take interim charge before Amorim&#8217;s arrival.
