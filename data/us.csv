Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Colin Allred will meet Tuesday night in the only debate of their Texas Senate race that could help determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.  Nationally, Democrats view Texas as one of their few potential pickup chances in the Senate this year, while much of their attention is focused on defending seats that are crucial to their thin majority, including in Montana, Ohio and West Virginia.  Cruz has urged Republicans to take Texas seriously amid signs that he is in another competitive race.	https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XhsQbOGfiM9YyfRg7oTCyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04Mjk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/d51d111fd7092288e38d760971de2ce2	2024-10-15 04:07:00	Yahoo!
