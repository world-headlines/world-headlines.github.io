Today’s action targets both individual actors and sprawling sanctions evasion networks across 17 jurisdictions, including India, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Switzerland, Thailand, and Türkiye. In addition to disrupting global evasion networks, this action also targets domestic Russian importers and producers of key inputs and other materiel for Russia’s military-industrial base.“The United States and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “As evidenced by today’s action, we are unyielding in our resolve to diminish and degrade Russia’s ability to equip its war machine and stop those seeking to aid their efforts through circumvention or evasion of our sanctions and export controls.”The Department of State is also targeting sanctions evasion and circumvention in multiple third countries, including several PRC-based companies exporting dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia’s military-industrial base and entities and individuals in Belarus related to the Lukashenka regime’s support for Russia’s defense industry. State is also targeting several senior Russian Ministry of Defense officials and defense companies and those supporting Russia’s future energy production and exports. SANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILLThanks to the unprecedented international sanctions regime implemented by the United States and its global partners, Russia is ever more reliant on complex and expensive transnational schemes to procure critical technological and manufacturing components and machinery it needs to create its own weapons production capability. This includes sensitive dual-use goods such as those cited in the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s multilateral Common High Priority List (CHPL), developed by the United States, European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Today’s action by Treasury disrupts a number of those schemes by designating more than 120 individuals and entities, including those involved in illicit procurement networks and the financial facilitators that support them. Financial facilitators such as trust and corporate formation service providers—several of which were sanctioned today—are key nodes in sanctions evasion ecosystems, and actions against them can act as force multipliers by rippling disruptive effects through multiple sanctions evasion networks simultaneously.Many of today’s designations were enabled or informed with support from Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). For more information on these targets, please see Annex 1. RUSSIA’S MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL BASE Treasury is also targeting more than 150 Russia-based defense and related materiel, technology, manufacturing, and aerospace companies that procure or produce finished military products or key components, precursors, and machinery that enable Russia to build or maintain the weaponry it uses against Ukraine. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 2. ANNEX 1:  SANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILLRussian Defense Procurement Networks Operating in TürkiyeOFAC is targeting 14 entities and nine individuals, based primarily in Türkiye, that have facilitated the procurement of advanced weapons, components, and ammunition on behalf of Russian end-users critical to bolstering Russia’s military campaign, including the Russian Ministry of Defense and state-owned defense companies.
