Voices	TBILISI (Reuters) -Two U.S. pollsters commissioned by Georgian opposition forces called into question official results that showed the governing Georgian Dream party won last weekend's parliamentary election in the South Caucasus country, as opposition parties prepared to hold a new protest next week.  U.S. data and polling firm Edison Research, commissioned by the pro-opposition television channel Formula, said the differences between its own exit poll and the official results pointed to "manipulation" of the vote.  On Thursday, HarrisX, another U.S. pollster that ran an exit poll for pro-opposition television channel Mtavari Arkhi, said the official results were "statistically impossible".	https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/f992057a2c2658a18660fce62bd9aa3e	2024-11-01 08:49:31	Yahoo!
